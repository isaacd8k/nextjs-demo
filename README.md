- NextJS & React (server and UI)
- Strapi CMS (headless CMS)
- Webhooks to trigger builds on CMS changes
- Cloudinary (static images)

To run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The base directory structure was bootstrapped using with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
